# Chikashi's Puzzler Project

As a part of my coursework with Udacity, I created a simple mobile VR game, called Puzller.
The game is created with Unity and tested on Xiaomi RedMi Note 5 with a google-cardboard-compatible headset.

For the project, I creatred a user persona called Motokichi. He is a ramen-bar chef and has almost no experience in VR, but watches Sci-Fi movies very often with his wife in an IMAX-Theater nearby; he defenitely has an interest in 3D immersive experience.
